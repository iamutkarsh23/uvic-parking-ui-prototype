# U-Park

UI/UX Prototypes for UVic Parking App. 

Designed and evaluated the mobile application as part of UVic Coursework for **Human Computer Interaction** (SENG 310) in a group of four.

- **Low-Fidelity prototype** for the parking app through personas and scenarios (evaluating without the users)
- **Evaluation phase** - we used **Think aloud protocol followed by a Semi-structured interview.** Goals of the evaluation were to determine feedback from user based on Learnability, Efficiency, Satisfaction, Errors and Memorability.
- Based on the deductions from the Evaluation phase, a **Medium Fidelity Prototype** was designed using Proto.io
